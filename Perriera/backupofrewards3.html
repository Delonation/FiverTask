                                <p>In many ways, <b>Steve Arnold</b> is the consummate early years teacher – patient and
                                    positive – attentive to the building blocks of learning. He inspires his students to
                                    be curious, explore the natural world around them, and embrace the best of what’s
                                    new. In other ways, Steve breaks the mold. He bikes barefoot to school each morning,
                                    constructs worlds of engineering and imagination in and outside the classroom, and
                                    he crafts his own way of delivering our core curriculum, always through the eyes of
                                    his 5 and 6-year-old students. Generations of Renbrook studentsowe their love of
                                    learning and foundational academic skillset to his extraordinary work.<br><br>
                                    It was his response to the challenges of the pandemic that brought out the best in
                                    Steve’s approach. One might say that he spent 35 years preparing for this moment.
                                    The Renbrook trails that he created and tended to over the years became his
                                    classroom; his creative and flexible mindset allowed him to pivot around the needs
                                    of his students; and hisunrivaled work ethic allowed him to deliver on the
                                    considerable extra planning and communication required. Steve excelled precisely
                                    when his students needed him most.<br><br>
                                    Renbrook’s deeply engrained commitment to outdoor teaching and learning is due in no
                                    small part to Steve’s efforts. Ed Donahue, Steve’s longtime colleague in the ELC,
                                    reflects, “During his 35 years at Renbrook, Steve has literally blazed trails to
                                    help foster a deeper appreciation and enjoyment of the natural world here at
                                    Renbrook for students, colleagues, and parents.” Steve’s legacy will live on in our
                                    lasting dedication to bringing outdoor learning to life.

                                <p>Hello! My name is Francisca Barria-Lopez! I just graduated high school at the Academy
                                    of Aerospace and Engineering. I am currently a freshman in college at the University
                                    of Rochester studying international relations and health policy. In high school, I
                                    had a passion for debate and model united nations as well as a multitude of
                                    extracurricular activities. This includes the student council, national honors
                                    society and work here at the science center! I’ve worked on a multitude of projects
                                    in school as well such as a website for first generation high school students to
                                    guide them on the college process.<br><br>
                                    Currently, I have discovered my passion for science and advocating to begin working
                                    towards my degree. I’ve been participating in the Teen Innovation program at the
                                    Connecticut Science Center for four years now. This year, my group mates and I have
                                    decided to work on bacteria communication to show our love for biology and life
                                    sciences.<br><br>
                                    I discovered this passion of science due to the curiosity I had about how things
                                    worked and why they work a certain way. Seeing the different wonders of the world
                                    and figuring out how I can incorporate this in my day to day life also allowed me to
                                    realize how much I would love for everyone to experience this. </p>
