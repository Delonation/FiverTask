                    Bas lumbers over a crooked line…<br><br>

                    Bas lumbered over a crooked line of paver stones that led to the stairs, which he climbed one at a
                    time to the porch. Bas held open the screen door to knock shyly on the main door. No lights came on
                    inside. Reed might’ve forgotten all about Bas. He might’ve even forgotten about me. Bas went to the
                    window, cupped his hands around his eyes, and looked inside. The train’s reflection ran in one side
                    of his head and out the other. He moved down the porch to the next window. The train ended, and as
                    it continued westward, the street fell silent. I heard Bas breathing hard as he descended from the
                    porch. I heard each stair creak under his weight. I saw the railing, made of galvanized pipe, shake.
                    Bas stopped on the paver stones, halfway to his Cadillac. From there, he looked across the street
                    right at me, standing under the water tower in a moon shadow. But that wasn’t why Bas didn’t see me.
                    He was thinking about Cheyenne, and wondering who she was with. He was conjuring, for himself, an
                    image of Reed, which made me invisible.</p>
